# My Portfolio Website

Yo, so like, I built this website with next 13. I don't even know JavaScript. I'm not gonna lie. I used multiple videos and blogs and documentations and stuff.

Hope you like it. 

You can clone it and modify it for a quick portfolio. I am an ML Engineer so it was hard for me to build. If you don't want to waste time writing js code, 
you can modify this code and build yourself a portfolio.

## Steps to use this code

**1. Clone the repository**

**2. Navigate to Projects to put in some of the projects u been cooking**

**3. Make yourself a logo and change the logo to something that represents you**

**4. Get you a cool avatar and put it inside of src/components/Avatar.js**
